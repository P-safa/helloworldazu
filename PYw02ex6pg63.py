x = 2
(a) : print("x")
# x is printed as a string
(b) :print('x')
# same as (a)
(c) : print(x)
# the value is going to be printed
(d) : print("x+1")
# its gonna show exactly whats inside our double qoutation as a string
# (e) : print('x'+1)
# part (e) is a wrong line of code ,we cant do math operations on a string , doesn't make sense
(f) : print(x+1)
# 2+1=3
